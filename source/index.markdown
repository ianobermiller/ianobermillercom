Ian Obermiller is a software development engineer at Microsoft and a hobby open source developer. Ian, his wife Olivia, and his son Wellington live in Renton, Washington.

##Microsoft

Here at the mothership I work at [FUSE Labs](http://fuse.microsoft.com), aka the [Social Ninja Assault Force](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/05/21/meet-fuse-labs-the-formerly-obscure-microsoft-division-that-built-so-cl/). We are implementing and researching new and awesome ways to make computers more social, since people are really the most essential and basic concept in computing. I love what I do, and working for Microsoft has all sorts of perks, not the least of which is being able to work and communicate with thousands of really intelligent people. Getting to test beta and earlier products is certainly up there as well!

##Education

I'm currently pursuing my master's in computer science from the University of Washington via the [PMP](http://pmp.cs.washington.edu). The courses are awesome, if a bit fast paced and intense.

I graduated summa cum laude from [Marquette University](http://mu.edu) with an Honors Bachelors degree in Computer Science. In addition to taking a full load of credits and coding on the side as a web developer, I also worked in the [Ubicomp Lab](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~ubicomp/), focusing on wireless, pervasive computing.

##For Fun

When I am not on the computer for work related activities I enjoy reading [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), coding various utilities, open source programming, and learning new programming languages and techniques. Outside of the digital world, I love spending every waking moment with my beautiful wife Olivia and my awesome son Wellington, snowboarding, reading, cooking, watching TV & movies, and occasionally hitting the gym.
